 <!--Media Streaming Popularity Tracker
Problem Name: topKPopularMedia
Problem Description:
You are building a media analytics feature for a streaming platform. Users watch movies, shows, or videos, and each view is logged with the title and watch duration.
Your task is to find the top K most-watched media items based on the total watch time.
Write a function topKPopularMedia(logs, K) that:
Takes an array of logs, where each log is an object { title: string, duration: number }.
Calculates the total watch time for each unique media title.
Returns an array of the top K titles sorted by highest total watch time.
If two titles have the same total watch time, sort them alphabetically.
Function Signature:
function topKPopularMedia(logs, K) {
// Your code here
}
Input:
logs: Array of objects. Each object represents a single watch session with:
title (string): Name of the media
duration (number): Time watched in minutes (1 ≤ duration ≤ 1000)
K (number): The number of top titles to return (1 ≤ K ≤ number of unique titles)
Output:
Array of strings representing the top K media titles based on total watch time, sorted descending by total watch time.
Example 1:
let logs = [
{ title: "Action Blast", duration: 120 },
{ title: "Laugh Riot", duration: 90 },
{ title: "Action Blast", duration: 100 },
{ title: "Family Fun", duration: 80 },
{ title: "Laugh Riot", duration: 60 }
];
let K = 2;
topKPopularMedia(logs, K);
// Output: ["Action Blast", "Laugh Riot"]
Explanation:
"Action Blast" total = 120 + 100 = 220
"Laugh Riot" total = 90 + 60 = 150
"Family Fun" total = 80
Top 2 are "Action Blast" and "Laugh Riot"
Input:
logs: Array of objects. Each object represents a single watch session with:
title (string): Name of the media
duration (number): Time watched in minutes (1 ≤ duration ≤ 1000)
K (number): The number of top titles to return (1 ≤ K ≤ number of unique titles)
Output:
Array of strings representing the top K media titles based on total watch time, sorted descending by total watch time.
Example 1:
let logs = [
{ title: "Action Blast", duration: 120 },
{ title: "Laugh Riot", duration: 90 },
{ title: "Action Blast", duration: 100 },
{ title: "Family Fun", duration: 80 },
{ title: "Laugh Riot", duration: 60 }
];
let K = 2;
topKPopularMedia(logs, K);
// Output: ["Action Blast", "Laugh Riot"]
Explanation:
"Action Blast" total = 120 + 100 = 220
"Laugh Riot" total = 90 + 60 = 150
"Family Fun" total = 80
Top 2 are "Action Blast" and "Laugh Riot"
Example 2:
let logs = [
{ title: "Movie A", duration: 30 },
{ title: "Movie B", duration: 30 },
{ title: "Movie C", duration: 50 }
];
let K = 2;
topKPopularMedia(logs, K);
// Output: ["Movie C", "Movie A"]
Explanation:
"Movie C" = 50, "Movie A" = 30, "Movie B" = 30
Tie between "Movie A" and "Movie B", so we pick alphabetically → "Movie A"
Constraints:
logs.length <= 10^4
1 <= logs[i].duration <= 1000
1 <= K <= number of unique media titles  -->
