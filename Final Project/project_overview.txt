Title: Ocean Stratification and Water Layer Circulation


Caption: The image shows how the ocean is divided into layers based on temperature, a process known as stratification. The top layer is lighter in color and warmer, marked at about 22°, while the deeper layers are darker and cooler, labeled 10° and 4°. Arrows within the layers show circular water movement, with separate circulation occurring in the warm surface water and the colder deep water. Wind is shown moving across the surface from left to right, helping mix the top layer, while the sun represents solar heating that warms the surface water.


Take Away: Just like how hot air is less dense than cold air. Warm water is less dense than cold water. This figure is important because it explains how temperature differences create layers in the ocean that do not easily mix. Warm, less dense water stays near the surface, while colder, denser water sinks deeper, affecting how heat and nutrients move through the ocean. The image also shows that wind mainly impacts the surface layer, leaving deeper water more isolated. By understanding ocean stratification, you can better see how ocean circulation influences climate, marine life, and energy transfer in the ocean.
