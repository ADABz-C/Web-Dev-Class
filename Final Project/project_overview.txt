Project Overview

Project Concept

This project is a Webtoon Title Search application that allows users to
search for Webtoon series and instantly view detailed information such
as the title, description, genres, and thumbnail images. The
system interacts with the Webtoon API to retrieve real-time data and
display it to the user through a clean, user-friendly interface.

Why This Theme Was Chosen

Webtoons are extremely popular among young audiences and digital
readers. This theme was chosen because: - It provides a fun and
relatable context for practicing web development. - It allows
integration with a real API, which demonstrates practical skills. - It
offers opportunities to include interactive features, data parsing, and
asynchronous logic.

Interactive Features Included

-   Search Bar: Users can type a Webtoon title and receive matching
    results.
-   Dynamic Display: When a match is found, the page updates with:
    -   Title
    -   Description
    -   Thumbnail image
    -   Genres
-   Error Handling: Displays messages when a title isn’t found.
-   API Integration: Fetches live data from the Webtoon RapidAPI
    service.

The Async Operation Used

The project includes asynchronous operations using: - async and await -
The fetch() API call to retrieve data from the Webtoon API - Awaiting
JSON parsing of the response - Non-blocking execution to keep the
interface responsive while data loads

Example:

    const response = await fetch(url, options);
    const data = await response.json();

Brief Notes for the Grader

-   The project demonstrates full use of asynchronous JavaScript.
-   API calls are correctly structured with proper headers.
-   User interface updates only after the asynchronous data retrieval
    completes.
-   The code is organized for readability and easy grading.
-   A working search feature confirms proper API integration and DOM
    manipulation.
